<div id="intro-contents">
  <p>We give the utmost importance to privacy. Following is a brief view of how we ensure privacy of our members and the content posted in the network.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each organization on Flocked-in lives in a separate Network that assures the privacy of its Members and the User Content posted in that Network.
    <li>A Network is defined by the organization's email domain. Before a member can join a network, they must confirm their email address.
    <li>All the content on Flocked-in is transmitted over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.
    <li>Members have ownership of all the content posted on Flocked-in, until their organization claims the network, after which the organization gains ownership.
    <li>Flocked-in's employees and the tools they use do not have access to the content in the network. Only specialized personnel will be granted access on a case-by-case basis, or as may be required by law. A detailed log is maintained for each such instance.
  </ul>

<p>Similar to most web sites, we collect information about your computer such as IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages and Operating System.</p>
<p>We use "cookies" to store and sometimes track user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your browser.</p>

<p><b>Rights to Opt In / Opt Out</b></p>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive our promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication</p>

<p><b>Use of Information</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>We will use your Personal Information to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings</li>
  <li>We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Website Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including (without limitation) any of our other websites and third parties.</li>
  <li>If you choose to import your address book contacts as part of Flocked-in's invitation process, we may store those names and emails and display them to other Network members on the Website in order to customize the Service for you and to enable you and coworkers in your Network to generate subsequent invitations.</li>
  <li>We may send you notices (for example, in the form of emails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies, events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from us by following the instructions in the Rights to Opt In/Opt Out section above.</li>
  <li>In addition, we may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and emails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Sharing Information with Third Parties</b></p>
<p>We will not share, rent or sell your Personal Information to other parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><b>Aggregate Statistics</b></p>
<p>We may disclose non-personally identifiable aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and emails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports, which do not describe or identify any individual user. Information relating to aggregate statistics may be collected through the use of third-party cookies and other third party tracking devices.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to</p>

  <li>protect and defend our rights and property, the Website, the users of the Website, and/or our Affiliated Parties;
  <li>act under circumstances to protect the safety of users of our Website, us, or third parties.
</ul>

<p><b>Business Transfer</b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use personal information you have provided through this Website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If this occurs, we will notify you as described in "Updates to our Privacy Policy"</p>

<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We encrypt our transmission of information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.</p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.</p>
<p>While Flocked-in endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information provided to this Website, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at <u>privacy@flocked.in</u> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>

<p><b>Updates</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in our online information practices. We will post a prominent notice on this Website to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the top of the statement when it was most recently updated.</p>
